What is Acid?
=======
Acid is a utility library for building CWAs (Conscious Web Apps). CWAs build themselves based on realtime application demands. Think of a bridge being formed in front of you as you're walking. Acid embraces a modular philosophy that results in a complete separation of concerns. [Documentation](https://acidjs.com)
